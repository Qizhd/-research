Hi there, 

Did you know that last year, in 2018, API testing is the highest growing method of testing for Agile and DevOps teams? 

With RESTful APIs invading our software stack and becoming more popular - it is critical to create an end-to-end API testing strategy using the right set of tools. SoapUI Pro helps eliminate the complexity of REST testing, by enabling you to build, execute, and automate API tests at scale. 

Join me this week for a webinar on REST Testing Made Easy with SoapUI Pro. 

You'll walk away knowing more about: 
The basics of testing with REST APIs
Creating and executing REST API tests with a few clicks
Maintaining your tests as APIs change
Reporting on REST API test results
Automating your REST API tests in just three steps
